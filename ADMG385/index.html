		<h1> OverBridge LLC. Possible Benefit Package Supplementation </h1>
		<p>OverBridge employees currently have a benefit package in which employees receive benefits such as health care coverage, dental coverage, and 401k options. As the option is available, added benefits will be considered to be added as a supplement to the current package and as such, a survey was conducted to determine which supplement employees wish to have. </p>

		<ul>
			<li> Wellness Program </li>
				<dd> Overbridge LLC. will provide employees with personal coaches, gym memberships, and other services in exchange for a reduced health premium. </dd>
			<li> Paid Family Medical Leave Benefit </li>
				<dd> Overbridge LLC. will provide qualified employees up to 12 weeks of paid, job-protected leave per year ontop of state and federal regulations. </dd>
			<li> A Combination of Both </li>

		<h2 id="Results"> What Is Recommended </h2>
		<!-- Use graph in powerpoint -->
		<img src="Results.png">
		<p> While employees overall want the 12-week paid family medical leave, a large number of employee's chose a combination of both benefits. As such, Overbridge LLC. is recommended to implement the combo supplement to the package as, while not having the most benefits as choosing one supplement over the other, will grant overall satisfaction as both options have been added in some way or form. </p>
		<h3> What Challenges Do We Expect To Face? </h3>
		<p> Through implementing both supplements in a combination, we can expect to see all the benefits listed above while also dealing with the same challenges presented in both options. </p>
		<p> These challenges include: </p>
			<ul id="Challenges">
				<li> Circulating workers </li>
					<dd> As Overbridge LLC. is a company of 2,000 employees, we will need to have plans in place to ensure that absence of employees for 6 weeks will not affect project completion and result in overall decrease in productivity. </dd>
				<li> Health Privacy Concerns </li>
					<dd> Due to the sensitive data needed to qualify employee's for both supplements, controls need to be set in place to ensure information does not leak and result in possible lawsuits towards the company. </dd>
				<li> Costs to Company </li>
					<dd> Annual budget must include financing for supporting multiple employees' paychecks for up to 6 weeks each while also accounting for gym membership enrollment and maintaining which can be 10$ monthly per employee should the cheapest option be chosen<sup>3, 4</sup>. </dd>
				<li> Creation of Department </li>
					<dd> As a combination of supplements require increased attention to scheduling, medical records, and 3rd party organization services, a new department dedicated to employee benefits management would need to be created.</dd>
