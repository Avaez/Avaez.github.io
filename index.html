	<h2> Info </h2>
		<p class="infoStart" scope="A quick rundown of what this site is for."> As you can see by this hastily made site, this is my website using basic html and css that I created at the time of writing this: <time> May 11th, 2:02AM PST</time></p>
		<p>The purpose of this site is to contain all files I would need to practice pentesting by hosting malicious files to be used by an assortment of devices. Which is my fancy way of saying basically phones/boxes that need to download some kind of revshell. With that in mind, malicious files will be marked in red and have a big h# element so don't come to me if you suddenly find yourself exposed.</p>
		<p> Should things permit (aka if I am not too lazy), this site will also have vulnerable forms and other weak web application elements. That's a hard maybe though since my current goal isn't to learn more html skills.</p>
